    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>When I'm not working on the Fullstack Academy Class or working at Caribou Coffee I do what I can to enjoy my free time wether it is rain or shine.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <img class="books" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.D_NzCBCYPYUdE8QLDP7JjgHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="fantasy book">
    <p>I love to read books, especially fantasy. Some of my favorite authors include Kim Harrison and Sarah J. Maas.<br>
        I am currently finishing A Court of Silver Flames by Sarah J. Maas and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.<br>
        My favorite book is The Hollows series by Kim Harrison. I love the world she created and the characters are so well developed. I just finished The Outlaw Demon Wails and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.</p>

    <h3>Kayaking</h3>

    <p>In Greensboro, NC Lake Brandt has kayaks avaible to rent. It is always peaceful out on the water and also a bit of a workout. I usually try to make it out at least once a week when the season is open.</p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>

    <p>I also enjoy playing video Games. My fianc√© and I have been playing Marvel Rivals, he usually plays tank and I usually play support/healer. We also recent started a new campagin on Baulders Gate 3. But when I'm playing solo I'm usually playing sims 3 or fortnite.</p>
    <h3>Crochet</h3>

    <p>I have been crocheting for about 5 years now. I love to make blankets and amigurumi. I am currently starting to work on the Christmas presnts for this year. I am also trying to learn how to make sweaters and wraps.</p>
